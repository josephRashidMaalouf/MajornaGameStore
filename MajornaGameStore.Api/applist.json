Play as one of four new vault hunters facing off against a massive new world of creatures, psychos and the evil mastermind, Handsome Jack.  Make new friends, arm them with a bazillion weapons and fight alongside them in 4 player co-op on a relentless quest for revenge and redemption across the undiscovered and unpredictable living planet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>All-New Characters and All-New Classes:</strong> Four all new playable classes including the Siren, the Commando, the Gunzerker and the Assassin. Step into the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow him to dual-wield any two weapons found in the game. Not only that, you will build on that skill to do more things with two guns than you ever imagined possible. Dual machine guns? Cool. Dual rocket launchers? Of course! Dual Sniper Rifles? Sure, if that\u2019s your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose from!<br><br></li><li><strong>Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN:</strong> Share your adventures with friends both online and via LAN. Borderlands 2 features a seamless system enabling you to drop in and drop out of a campaign without ever having to restart the game. On top of that you can even take your new gear from any game to any other!<br><br></li><li><strong>World Connected Story:</strong>  Find yourself left for dead in the frozen tundra of Pandora as you begin your quest of revenge and redemption. Expose the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the opening of the Vault.)<br><br></li><li><strong>87 Bazillion...Everything:</strong> In addition to the new gun system, you will lust after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods and much, much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot!<br><br></li><li><strong>Brand new environments on Pandora:</strong> Hunt through entirely brand new areas of Pandora that are more alive than ever!  From the arctic tundra, through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, you\u2019ll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn!<br><br></li><li><strong>Brand new enemies:</strong>  A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious predatory Stalkers and the Hyperion mechanical army, run by Handsome Jack, are just some of the new enemies in Borderlands 2.</li></ul>Note: The Mac and Linux versions of Borderlands 2 are available in English, French, Italian, German and Spanish only.",

Expose the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the opening of the Vault.)<br><br></li><li><strong>87 Bazillion...Everything:</strong> In addition to the new gun system, you will lust after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods and much, much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot!<br><br></li><li><strong>Brand new environments on Pandora:</strong> Hunt through entirely brand new areas of Pandora that are more alive than ever!  From the arctic tundra, through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, you\u2019ll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn!<br><br></li><li><strong>Brand new enemies:</strong>  A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious predatory Stalkers and the Hyperion mechanical army, run by Handsome Jack, are just some of the new enemies in Borderlands 2.</li></ul>Note: The Mac and Linux versions of Borderlands 2 are available in English, French, Italian, German and Spanish only.",

Each team, alien and human, has a Commander. The Commander looks down on the battlefield and issues orders, places structures, collects resources, researches technology, and deploys abilities. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline10_StrategyShooter.jpg?t=1639666850\" /><br><br>Here are some gameplay examples: A human Commander could drop health packs and ammunition to a trapped marine squad, and deploy sentry guns to help them defend their position. Or an alien Commander could grow a new Hive to spread infestation throughout newly captured territory, allowing more alien eggs to spawn...<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4920/extras/Inline11_BattleRoyale.jpg?t=1639666850\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Two Unique Sides</h2><br>Aliens players choose to evolve into one of five lifeforms: The fast, fearsome Skulk can run on walls and deliver massive damage with its jaws.

PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. <br><br>Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THREE WARRING EMPIRES</strong> </h2>Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2_3_Empires.jpg?t=1700252005\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MASSIVE WARFARE</strong> </h2>Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ENORMOUS MAPS</strong> </h2>PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings. <br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2_4_massive_continents.jpg?t=1700252005\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS</strong> </h2>In PlanetSide 2 the war isn\u2019t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CLASS-BASED COMBAT</strong></h2>Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics.

You are the beating heart of any squad. <br><br><strong>Infiltrator:</strong> Stay silent. Stay invisible.

You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. <br><br><strong>MAX:</strong> Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX).

Every child is unique. One child might be colorblind, another might have vertigo-- they could even be a dwarf.<br><br>That's OK, because no one is perfect, and you don't have to be perfect to win this game.  But you do have to be pretty darn good because this game is HARD.  Fortunately, every time you die all the gold you've collected can be used to upgrade you manor, giving your next child a step up in life and another chance at vanquishing evil.<br><br>But you shouldn't listen to me. You should check out the trailer. It explains the game better then I ever could. <br><br>If you really want to READ about this game though, then you should check out our bullet list below.<br><br><strong>Here's what Rogue Legacy IS: </strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A procedurally generated adventure. Explore new castles with every life. <br></li><li>Rogue-lite. Your character dies, but with each passing your lineage grows and becomes stronger. <br></li><li>Tons of unique traits that makes each playthrough special. Ever wanted to be dyslexic? Now you can! <br></li><li>More than 8 classes to choose from (9)! Each class has unique abilities that change the way you play the game. <br></li><li>Over 60 different enemies to test your skills against. Hope you like palette-swaps! <br></li><li>Massive, expandable skill tree. Rack in the loot to upgrade your manor and give your successors a cutting edge. <br></li><li>Oh yeah, there's a Blacksmith and an Enchantress shop but we forgot to show them in the trailer... <br></li><li>Equip your heroes with powerful weaponry and armor. Or gain new abilities like flight, dash, and air jumping. <br></li><li>Tons of secrets and easter eggs to uncover... or are there? Yes there are. <br></li><li>Got a controller?

Play as The Guy, whose parents apparently were too lazy to give him a proper name. Experience feudal injustice, inquisition, witch-hunting, and join The Grand Tournament. Meet valiant, yet incredibly stupid knights. Complete a wide variety of twisted missions and quests, or don\u2019t give a damn about the plot and bring mayhem in the villages and cities. Choose to go on foot, or by a stolen horse. Fight with a sword or pick a fancy automatic crossbow. All that, spiced up with an inappropriate Monty Python inspired sense of humor.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/844260/extras/benis2.gif?t=1690487981\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Be a bold, bald thug in a medieval sandbox</h2><br>Rustler\u2019s world is filled with humor, anachronisms, and pop culture references. Ever been towed for parking in a \u201cNO HORSE ZONE\u201d? Wanna do some cage fights in Medieval Martial Arts Arena? Or maybe pimp-a-horse a little? How about joining the Round-Earthers sect? <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/844260/extras/arm_cut2.gif?t=1690487981\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wreak havoc in top-down, old-school combat</h2><br>Use swords, spears, turds, and crossbows. Want to get more efficient? Try holy hand grenades or\u2026 horses. Nothing\u2019s more deadly than hooves galloping in your direction. Or drifting a cart. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/844260/extras/throwing_cow2.gif?t=1690487981\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Screw everyone over to win half the kingdom</h2><br>As a poor peasant, you really need to get creative in order to win the Grand Tournament\u2122.

        "about_the_game": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Grand Theft\u2026 Horse</h2><br>Rustler is an open-world, top-down action game paying tribute to the good old GTA style and gameplay, fusing it with a <strong>historically inaccurate</strong> medieval setting. Play as The Guy, whose parents apparently were too lazy to give him a proper name. Experience feudal injustice, inquisition, witch-hunting, and join The Grand Tournament. Meet valiant, yet incredibly stupid knights. Complete a wide variety of twisted missions and quests, or don\u2019t give a damn about the plot and bring mayhem in the villages and cities. Choose to go on foot, or by a stolen horse. Fight with a sword or pick a fancy automatic crossbow. All that, spiced up with an inappropriate Monty Python inspired sense of humor.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/844260/extras/benis2.gif?t=1690487981\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Be a bold, bald thug in a medieval sandbox</h2><br>Rustler\u2019s world is filled with humor, anachronisms, and pop culture references. Ever been towed for parking in a \u201cNO HORSE ZONE\u201d? Wanna do some cage fights in Medieval Martial Arts Arena? Or maybe pimp-a-horse a little? How about joining the Round-Earthers sect? <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/844260/extras/arm_cut2.gif?t=1690487981\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wreak havoc in top-down, old-school combat</h2><br>Use swords, spears, turds, and crossbows. Want to get more efficient? Try holy hand grenades or\u2026 horses. Nothing\u2019s more deadly than hooves galloping in your direction. Or drifting a cart. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/844260/extras/throwing_cow2.gif?t=1690487981\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Screw everyone over to win half the kingdom</h2><br>As a poor peasant, you really need to get creative in order to win the Grand Tournament\u2122.
